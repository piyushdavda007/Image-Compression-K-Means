# Image-Compression-K-Means

- So this project basically does the compression of images based on colors.
- By millions of colors in images this will reduce that colors to your desired value of colors.
- Currently I setted maximum of 256 values but you can change that by doing simple modification in code


# What I have done

- In this project, I applied the k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using 
scikit-learn and Python to build an image compression application with interactive controls.
- First I conducted basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization.
- Then I applied a computationally time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, 
to compress images.
- And then I used the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images
from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.
